# Ising Models

My first stab at using pyOpenCL, for GPU parallelized simulation of the 2D and 3D Ising models, and the XY model, which can definitely be improved.
Includes Animations and T_c calculation example.
TODO: Fix the 3D_Ising Kernel, switch from matplotlib to openGL for realtime viewing (plotting is easily what takes the most time as of now)
